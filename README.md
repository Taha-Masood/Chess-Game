- The program accounts for basic rules such as movement path, board dimensions and current layout
- The program also accounts for advanced components such as pawn movement, check and checkmate
- The program is functional using standard input and output for ease of access
- To compile with the Python GUI, read the "import" comment at the top of the file 


## Python - Component: 

-  The program produces a graphical user interface utilizing the TkInter library in Python
- The program refreshes and redraws the board after every valid move is inputted 
- The function employs mouse events to pick up and drag the chess pieces in order to move them.
